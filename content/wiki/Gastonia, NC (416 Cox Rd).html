<b><i>416 Cox Rd, Store #635</b></i> is a Chuck E. Cheese's in Gastonia, North Carolina that opened on November 27th, 2005.
<h2>History</h2>
Gastonia opened on November 27th, 2005 with a Studio C Beta, 16m in a freestanding building. When the store opened, they had the 2005 Update of the 2003 'Cool Chuck' Reconfiguration / Major Remodel Initiative like all other stores opening at the time. In 2010, Gastonia would receive an expansion which relocated the Showroom to the new part of the store, converting the original Showroom into an expanded Gameroom. This store would become the last Studio C Beta in North Carolina after <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Concord, NC (7970 Lyles Lane)" >}}">Concord, NC (7970 Lyles Lane)</a> would receive the 2.0 Remodel in March 2023. As of october 14 2024, Gastonia has received the 2.0 remodel removing the animatronic.

<h2> Trivia </h2><ul><li>Gastonia was one of the few locations to add shoes onto their Chuck E. Cheese Animatronic (One of two to do so in North Carolina, The other to do so was <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Greensboro, NC (702-A Pembroke Rd)" >}}">Greensboro</a> which was a 3-Stage. <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Wilmington, NC (4389 Oleander Dr)" >}}">Wilmington</a> {Another 3-Stage store} was also supposed to do this before they closed in 2020 according to the store's management but it didn't happen due to store closure). <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Visalia, CA (4345 W Noble Ave)" >}}">Visalia</a> (3-Stage), Cordova, TN (1636 N Germantown Pkwy)|Cordova (Studio C Beta, 32m; Removed in October 2021), & Corporate also put shoes on the Chuck E. Cheese Animatronics as well.</li><li>Weirdly enough, Gastonia was built inside a hill according to street view imagery, making the exterior not fully viewable from a certain angle.</li><li>Before the COVID-19 Pandemic, Gastonia was originally planned to get 2.0 in around April 2020; if the plan has had happened, they would of had a 2019 Model Dance Floor.</li></ul>
